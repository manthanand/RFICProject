SP SP1[1] <ECE382M:Testbench:schematic>   freq=(1 GHz->10 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The global circuit temperature (25 C or 298.15 K) and the IEEE standard
    noise temperature (16.85 C or 290 K) do not agree in the noise
    analysis `SP1'.  As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio loss at the
    the circuit temperature and the noise figure, defined and calculated
    at the standard noise temperature, might not agree for a passive circuit
    as well.  The `Temp' parameter on the `Options' item (25 C) can be set to
    16.85 C to eliminate this discrepancy.
